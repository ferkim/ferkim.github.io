        <!-- Not a long time ago, mi daddy bought this domain
             for me. I was 3 months old and he was the happiest
             daddy in the world. He could not belive that he
             had such a beautiful family.
             He had big expectations for me: I was going to be
             a very smart engineer, or maybe an important doctor,
             the most famous chef perhaps. He was looking forward
             I could give my email: soy@fernanda.kim. How many
             kids can have their own domain with a custom email
             address?
             I was about 18 months when my daddy found that my
             mother was cheating on her. He decided to take a
             DNA test and found that I was not her daughter.
             After a second DNA test he realized that this was
             not his family. That my mother made the worst thing
             a woman can do to a man, and with a lot of pain and
             a broken heart, he left us. He knew that I will be
             fine: I have the most awesome grandparents who will
             take care of me whenever its needed. And my mother
             is a very intelligent woman who will know how to
             overcome this situation.
             My ex-daddy misses me, I don't remember him but
             someday I will ask my mother why I don't have a
             father like the other kids. I hope that my mom gives 
             me the truth, this way I won't hate my ex-daddy 
             for leaving me.
             I hope that in the future I will meet him again,
             Despite I should know the truth but I will be eager
             to know him, to know what he does, what happened
             after he left us, the hell that was his life after
             he found what my mother did to him, but he will tell
             me how happy he will be by then.
